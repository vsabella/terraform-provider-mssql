# mssql_script (Resource)

Manages arbitrary SQL scripts with Terraform lifecycle tracking.

Use this resource to install tools, run bootstrap scripts, or execute any SQL that needs to be managed as infrastructure.

The script is executed on create and when the version changes. Terraform tracks the version in state to determine when to re-run the script.

delete_script is only executed when the resource is destroyed (not when version changes).

**Example usage:**
```hcl
resource "mssql_script" "first_responder_kit" {
  database_name = "master"
  name          = "first_responder_kit"
  create_script = file("${path.module}/install-blitz.sql")
  delete_script = "DROP PROC sp_Blitz"
  version       = md5(file("${path.module}/install-blitz.sql"))
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `create_script` (String) T-SQL script to execute on create and when version changes. Changing this without changing `version` will update state but will **not** re-run the script; bump `version` to re-execute.
- `database_name` (String) Database where the script will be executed.
- `name` (String) Logical name for the script (used for identification in state). Changing this forces a new resource.
- `version` (String) Version string to track script changes. When this changes, the create_script is re-executed in-place (no destroy/recreate). Typically set to `md5(file("script.sql"))` to automatically detect file changes.

### Optional

- `delete_script` (String) T-SQL script to execute on destroy. If not provided, no cleanup is performed.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource identifier in format `<server_id>/<database>/<name>` where `server_id` is `host:port`.

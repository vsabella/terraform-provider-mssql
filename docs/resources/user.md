Manages a SQL Server database user. Supports both contained users (with password) and login-based users (mapped to a server login).



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `username` (String) Database user name. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Optional

- `database` (String) Target database for the user. If not specified, uses the provider's configured database. Changing this forces a new resource.
- `default_schema` (String) Default schema for the user. Defaults to `dbo`.
- `external` (Boolean) Is this an external user (like Microsoft EntraID). Mutually exclusive with `password` and `login_name`.
- `login_name` (String) Name of the server login to map this user to. Use this for traditional login-based users (e.g., RDS SQL Server). When set, the user is created with `CREATE USER ... FOR LOGIN ...`. Mutually exclusive with `password`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for contained database users. Must follow strong password policies defined for SQL server. Passwords are case-sensitive, length must be 8-128 chars, can include all characters except `'` or `name`.

~> **Note** Password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

~> **Note** Either `password` or `login_name` must be specified, but not both. Use `password` for contained database users (Azure SQL) or `login_name` for traditional login-mapped users (RDS SQL Server).
- `sid` (String) Set custom SID for the user.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
